# Spotify Soul Recommender
This machine learning project creates a personalized soulful playlist based on the soulful songs you already have in your favorites. Assuming you're into that kind of vibe :) 

## How it works
This works by filtering your Top 50 Tracks by genre. Specially looking for songs that fit these genres: 
'contemporary', 'r&b', 'lofi', 'soul', 'jazz', 'neo', 'blue', 'chillwave', 'lo-fi', 'chill', 'soul'

The features of these songs are used to train the model to know what kind of soulful songs you're into.

Once that's done, the model goes through my custom made library of over 6,000 soulful songs and finds the top 10 songs that you would most likely enjoy.

and boom, just like that, you have a new soulful playlist to listen too.
