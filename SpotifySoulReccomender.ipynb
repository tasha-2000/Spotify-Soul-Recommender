    "# Spotify Soul Recommender Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spotify Soul Recommender is a machine learning project designed to curate a personalized playlist of soulful songs based on a user's existing favorite tracks. By analyzing the genres and features of the songs a user enjoys, the project identifies and recommends soulful tracks that align with their musical preferences. The goal is to enhance the user's listening experience by introducing them to new songs that fit the vibe of contemporary R&B, lofi, soul, jazz, and similar genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.8+\n",
    "- Spotipy\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)\n",
    "- Your Spotify API credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read the whole setup section before you clone the project to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Clone the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/tasha-2000/Spotify-Soul-Recommender.git\n",
    "cd Spotify-Soul-Recommender\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then run each install command one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install spotipy pandas scikit-learn imblearn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure Spotify API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Spotify API, you need to set up your Spotify API credentials. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials in the file `credentials.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "clientId = 'your_spotify_client_id'\n",
    "clientSecret = 'your_spotify_client_secret'\n",
    "redirectUri = 'your_app_redirect_uri'\n",
    "username = 'your_spotify_username'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is collected from Spotify using the Spotipy library. Here is a snippet of code to initialize the spotify client:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import spotipy\n",
    "from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth\n",
    "import credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "def SetUpSpotifyClient():\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Initializes and returns a Spotify client using OAuth.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    scope = 'user-top-read playlist-modify-private playlist-modify-public user-library-read user-top-read'\n",
    "    return spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id=credentials.clientId,\n",
    "                                                     client_secret=credentials.clientSecret,\n",
    "                                                     redirect_uri=credentials.redirectUri,\n",
    "                                                     scope=scope))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sets of data collected:\n",
    "1. Soulful tracks directly from Spotify official playlists.\n",
    "2. The user's favorite soulful tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this project, a track is considered to be 'soulful' if its genres contain any one of these keywords: \n",
    "`keywords = {'contemporary', 'r&b', 'lofi', 'soul', 'jazz', 'neo soul', 'blues', 'chillwave', 'lo-fi', 'chill', 'soul'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soulful Tracks from Spotify Official Playlist\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves searching for 50 playlists that match specific soulful genres (i.e., the names of the playlist contain any of those keywords) and extracting the first 50 track IDs from each of these playlists. This code snippet demonstrates how that is done:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to find Spotify official playlists with soulful genres\n",
    "def FindSoulfulPlaylists(sp, keywords):\n",
    "    playlistIds = set()\n",
    "    for keyword in keywords:\n",
    "        results = sp.search(q=f'\"{keyword}\"', type='playlist', limit=50)\n",
    "        for playlist in results['playlists']['items']:\n",
    "            if 'spotify' in playlist['owner']['id']:\n",
    "                playlistIds.add(playlist['id'])\n",
    "    return playlistIds\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to get tracks from playlists\n",
    "def GetTracksFromPlaylist(sp, playlistIds):\n",
    "    trackIds = []\n",
    "    for playlistId in playlistIds:\n",
    "        results = sp.playlist_items(playlistId, limit=50, fields='items.track.id')\n",
    "        trackIds.extend([item['track']['id'] for item in results['items'] if item['track']])\n",
    "    return trackIds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The User's Favorite Soulful Tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "This function works by searching for tracks that match the specified genres within the user's top 50 tracks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to find soulful tracks in the user's library\n",
    "def FindSoulfulTracks(sp):\n",
    "    keywords = {'contemporary', 'r&b', 'lofi', 'soul', 'jazz', 'neo soul', 'blues', 'chillwave', 'lo-fi', 'chill'}\n",
    "    results = sp.current_user_top_tracks(limit=50, time_range='long_term')\n",
    "    trackIds = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    for item in results['items']:\n",
    "        artistIds = [artist['id'] for artist in item['artists']]\n",
    "        isMatch = False\n",
    "        for artistId in artistIds:\n",
    "            artist\n",
    "\n",
    "Genres = sp.artist(artistId)['genres']\n",
    "            if any(keyword in genre for keyword in keywords for genre in artistGenres):\n",
    "                isMatch = True\n",
    "                break\n",
    "        if isMatch:\n",
    "            trackIds.append(item['id'])\n",
    "    return trackIds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Extraction and Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting the track IDs, we extract audio features for each track using the Spotify API. These features include tempo, energy, danceability, and others that are relevant for understanding the 'soulfulness' of a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to extract features from track IDs\n",
    "def ExtractFeatures(sp, trackIds):\n",
    "    features = []\n",
    "    for i in range(0, len(trackIds), 50):\n",
    "        batch = trackIds[i:i+50]\n",
    "        features.extend(sp.audio_features(batch))\n",
    "    return features\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these features, we then train a machine learning model to distinguish between soulful and non-soulful tracks. The choice of model and the training process are based on standard practices in music recommendation systems, such as using classification algorithms like Random Forest or SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the process of building a Spotify Soul Recommender. From setting up the environment, collecting data from Spotify, extracting features, to training a machine learning model, each step is crucial for developing an effective recommendation system. The project aims to personalize music listening experiences by discovering and recommending new soulful tracks to users, enhancing their connection to music.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements can include refining the model with more complex algorithms or incorporating user feedback loops to improve recommendations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This revised version provides a clearer and more comprehensive guide on setting up, collecting data, extracting features, and training a model for the Spotify Soul Recommender project. Note that while the code snippets should work as intended, they are dependent on the correct setup of your Spotify API credentials and the installation of the necessary Python packages. Always test your code in your local environment to ensure everything functions as expected."
